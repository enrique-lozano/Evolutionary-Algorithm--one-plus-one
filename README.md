# My-Readme-Template 💥💯

Brief description of a few lines about the project, technologies used in the development... Use emoticons in each of the readMe titles, so that they correctly represent the section.

## Run it 🚀

### Pre-requistes ⛔

First of all, make sure you have python installed, in version 3. For more information on this, visit the docs at https://www.python.org/

You will need to install some dependencies via pip, entering the following commands in the root folder of the project:

```sh
pip install requests
```

```sh
pip install numpy
```

### Usage example 💡

Just run in the terminal:

```sh
python script.py
```

In Linux or MacOS, you might have to type instead:

```sh
python3 script.py
```

The script.py should be replaced for one of this:

-   1+1.py
-   Mu+Lamda.py
-   MuLamda.py

Once the command is entered, the execution of the script will begin, which will perform the specified algorithm 5 times. The results of these five iterations can be seen in the results.txt files.

**Warning:** _This project has been fully developed in python 3.7, so its operation for previous versions is not guaranteed_

## What are these algorithms? 🧠

## Issues 🤕

This project depends on the operation of an external server, which may be unavailable at the time of execution.
